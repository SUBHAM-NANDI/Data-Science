    "# that aims to create machines and systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.\n",
    "# AI involves the development of algorithms and models that can learn, reason, problem-solve, \n",

    "# Example : An excellent example of AI is self-driving cars. Imagine a car equipped with AI-powered sensors,\n",
    "# cameras, and processing units. The AI system in the car can analyze real-time data from the environment, \n",

    "# or take actions based on that learning.\n",
    "# Example : Consider an email spam filter. In this case, the machine learning model is trained using \n",
    "# a large dataset of emails, some of which are labeled as spam and others as legitimate. \n",
    "# The ML algorithm learns from the patterns in these emails and identifies characteristics that \n",
