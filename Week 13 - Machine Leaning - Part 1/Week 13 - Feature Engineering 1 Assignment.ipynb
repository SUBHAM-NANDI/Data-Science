    "# Q1. What is the Filter method in feature selection, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Filter method is a feature selection technique used in machine learning to select \n",
    "# relevant features from a dataset before training a model. It operates independently of\n",
    "# the learning algorithm and ranks features based on their individual characteristics. \n",
    "# The selection process is primarily based on statistical measures, such as correlation, \n",
    "# mutual information, or significance tests, which evaluate the relationship between each \n",
    "# feature and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The general steps of the Filter method are as follows:\n",
    "# Calculate a relevant metric (e.g., correlation, mutual information) for each feature\n",
    "# with respect to the target variable.\n",
    "# Rank the features based on their scores obtained from the metric.\n",
    "# Select the top-ranked features according to a predefined threshold or a fixed number \n",
    "# of features.\n"

    "# Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator): Lasso is a linear regression \n",

    "# values of the regression coefficients. This penalty encourages some coefficients to \n",
    "# become exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ridge Regression: Similar to Lasso, Ridge Regression adds a penalty term to the loss \n",
    "# function but based on the squared values of the regression coefficients. \n",
    "# It can help reduce the impact of less relevant features on the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Elastic Net: Elastic Net is a combination of Lasso and Ridge Regression, \n",
    "# incorporating both the absolute and squared values of regression coefficients. \n",
    "# It can handle multicollinearity and perform feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
